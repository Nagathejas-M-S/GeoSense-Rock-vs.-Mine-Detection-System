# GeoSense-Rock-vs.-Mine-Detection-System

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline to predict whether an underwater object detected via sonar is a rock or a mine.

---

## Problem Objective

Develop a machine learning model to classify objects (rock or mine) based on sonar signal features. The dataset used includes sonar returns with extracted features such as frequency bands, signal intensities, and waveform characteristics.

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Sonar Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/sonarcsv)
- **Size**: 208 rows Ã— 61 columns
- **Features**:
  - **Frequencies**: Measurements of signal frequencies.
  - **Amplitudes**: Intensity of sonar signal returns.
  - **Time-domain features**: Echoes and temporal patterns.
  - **Statistical measures**: Mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis of signal properties.
  - **Waveform analysis**: Signal shape and spatial characteristics.

## Approach

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Feature engineering.
   - Handling missing values (if any).
   - Label encoding for binary classification.
   
2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Algorithms used:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Regression
     - Decision Tree Regression
     - XGB Regression
   - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

4. **Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Model testing on unseen data.
   - Comparative analysis to identify the best model based on performance metrics.

5. **Result Analysis**:
   - Final model selected: Logistic Regression.
   - Logistic Regression demonstrated the highest accuracy and precision while minimizing false positives for rock predictions.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model was identified as the most suitable for this problem based on:
- High accuracy and precision.
- Low false positive rate for rocks.

## Real-World Application

This project addresses real-world challenges in underwater object detection using sonar data. The binary classification model has the potential to enhance decision-making in marine exploration, defense applications, and underwater robotics.

---

## Future Scope

- Expanding feature engineering to include more sonar signal characteristics.
- Experimenting with ensemble methods to improve classification accuracy further.
- Developing a real-time sonar classification system.
